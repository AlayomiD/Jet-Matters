   <h1> <li>THE MOST EXPENSIVE JET: AIR FORCE ONE - $660MILLION </li></h1>
   <p> <img src="IMAGES/Jet.jpeg" alt="No 1 Jet" width="800" height="450">  </p>
   <p>
    It's no surprise that one of the most well-known jets on the planet is also the most expensive private jet. This is Air Force
    <br>One - a highly customized Boeing 747-200B that comes with a price of $660 million.
    <br><br>
    <u>Air Force One</u> is the symbol of the American presidency recognized all over the world.
    <br><br>
    It comes with:
    <br><br>
    a fully equipped medical quarter (with an operating room included) and a medical team with a doctor is always on board
    <br>a conference room
    <br>two kitchens
    <br>multiple sleeping quarters.
    <br><br>
    This is all spread out over three decks and 4000 square feet.
    <br><br>
    Moreover, Air Force One is both physically and electronically hardened to protect the jet from an electromagnetic pulse. 
    <br>On top of this, it can be refueled mid-air and is always followed by two fighter jets.
    <br><br>
    While it's the most expensive aircraft it's also the most exclusive, and money alone won't get you a visitation on this plane!

<h1><li>THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRIVATE JET EVER MADE: AIRBUS A380 $600MILLION</li></h1>

    <p>
        The most expensive private jet ever made was a modified Airbus A380 for Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal al-Saud.
        <br><br>
Though the exact price is unknown, its cost is estimated at around $600 million. Interestingly enough, he sold it before even 
<br>taking delivery, to an unnamed billionaire.
<br><br>
According to Jet Base, the Airbus A380 was initially purchased for $400 million but an extra $200 million was invested in
<br> redecoration and vast rebuilding of the jet.
<br><br>
The interior was designed by the famous interior designer Edese Doret, and he designed it according to the wishes of the prince.
<br><br>
The final design was a jet of three floors with glass-made elevators to make the floor transfers easier. The jet also has a 
<br>Turkish bath with gold-plated finishes, a built-in garage where the prince can park his diamond-encrusted Rolls Royce, 
<br>and a prayer room where the mats automatically rotate to face Mecca.

<p>
    The third most expensive private jet belongs to none other than Russia's richest man Alisher Usmanov.
    <br><br>
Though he originally paid $238 million for the plane, he spared no expense in making it his own.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the details of the plane are kept highly secret, but alongside what must be a lavish
 <br>interior there's reportedly a nightclub too!
